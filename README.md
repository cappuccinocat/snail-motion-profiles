# Achatinidae Motion
Motion profiling/trajectory generating graphical website.

# Why is it called snail-motion-profiles / Achatinidae Motion Profiles?
Despite what it seems, it's not because it's slow! It's called Achatinidae for snails, since my robotics team nickname is Snail.

# Getting Started
To run the program, you must first clone the repository and install the dependencies.
To clone the repo, run:
```git clone git@github.com:cappuccinocat/snail-motion-profiles.git```
